This software is free to use, copy and modify for academic research purposes, AS LONG AS all the code relevant to your research work in numerical algorithms that you have published is distributed under similar (or more permissive) conditions.

If, on the other hand, you charge your fellow researchers money for your code, you will find it fair if I do the same.

If you redistribute this code, portions of it, or derived works, make sure to include proper attribution to this work.
If you use this code in a paper, CITE! In the academia we basically live off citation counts.

==FAQ==
Q: So, what does it mean exactly?
A: As mathematicians and lawyers are the worst tedious nitpicks around, I'd better include a more precise statement. Let us say that "A is nice to B" if all software written by A is free to use, copy and modify for academic research purposes by B. Let us say that a set of people S is "mutually nice" if A is nice to B for every A,B in S, and in addition S includes all people who never wrote any numerical algorithms code. It is left to the reader to prove that the intersection S_- of all mutually nice sets is is mutually nice. This software is free to use, copy and modify for all academic research purposes by all the elements of S_-.

Q: What is "academic research" exactly?
A: All research that you conduct for the primary purpose of publishing articles. In case of doubt, the primary author's interpretation is binding.

Q: What if I want to use this code in industry or if I do not satisfy the prerequisites for free use?
A: Contact the primary author.

Q: It is not clear to me whether I qualify for free use or not.
A: Contact the primary author.

Q: I have another doubt on the license.
A: Contact the primary author.
