==Prerequisites==

In order to use this Matlab library, you need:
* The MATLAB xUnit Test Framework, available at http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22846-matlab-xunit-test-framework
  This is just syntax sugar for efficient testing.
* CAREX (optional, if you wish to run the tests and for some subroutines) from http://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/mpcsc/benner/software.php?lang=en
  This is a benchmark set for algebraic Riccati equations.

Both packages should be installed and in Matlab's path (adjust it with the command 'pathtool', and optionally save it to the current directory). For xUnit, this means that the folder $(INSTALL)DIR)/matlab_xunit/xunit should be in the path.

==Installation==
Unpack and add to Matlab's path. You can check that everything works by typing the xUnit command 'runtests' in Matlab. You should get some warnings complaining about ill-conditioned matrices, but all the test should pass if you have everything installed properly.
